<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>FreeStock Finder is a simple search helper that links you to third‑party image websites such as Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay, and others.</p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic technical data from your browser (such as IP address, device type, and pages visited) for security and traffic statistics.</li>
    <li>A small cookie that stores your last search keyword so we can show it again below the search bar on your next visit for instant search.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not create user accounts and we do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.</p>

  <h2>3. How we use this information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To keep the website running and improve performance.</li>
    <li>To remember your last search keyword for convenience.</li>
    <li>To protect the site from abuse or technical problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your data and we do not use your data to build advertising profiles ourselves.</p>

  <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
  <p>We show ads served by third‑party ad networks, currently including Monetag. These partners may use their own cookies or similar technologies to show and measure ads and to protect against fraud. Their privacy policies and choices apply to this data.</p>

  <h2>5. Third‑party websites</h2>
  <p>When you click a link to an external image site (for example Pexels or Unsplash), you leave our website. Their terms and privacy policies apply on those sites, not ours.</p>

  <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear or block cookies in your browser settings at any time.</li>
    <li>You can choose not to use the site if you do not agree with this policy.</li>
  </ul>
